# Automatic-discovery-of-cyberattacks-Analytics
During my first year of master's studies at the University of Paris-Saclay, in collaboration with the Instituts for Technological Research SystemX, I participated in an R&D project. Based on the research paper "Automatic Discovery of Cyberattacks" by Hutzler, G., Klaudel, H., Klaudel, W., Pommereau, F., & Rajaj, A. (2024), published in Zenodo, we developed a simulator. This simulator gathers information about the paths attackers use to achieve their goals in a distributed system, aiming to enhance the security level of IoT distributed systems.
